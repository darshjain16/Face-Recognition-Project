# Face Recognition Project
In today's era the whole world is focuses on home security as a higher prior for many individuals and families, because most individuals and families spend 80% of their lives inside the buildings.  Illegal activities such as robbery, theft, and property damage are the primary concerns for any household. 
To overcome this kind of problem, we propose a smart face recognition security system using OpenCV which identifies and adapts to various faces and lighting conditions in real-time and finds unauthorized individuals.
